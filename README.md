# Lunar Descent Vehicle Project

## Introduction
In this project, a lunar descent vehicle will be designed to transport a payload from the lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon. The design of a lunar descent vehicle is a complex and challenging task, but for the sake of simplicity, the scope of the project is trimmed. This vehicle will be responsible for transporting a payload but should be designed suitable for a man-rating mission, and the fuel must be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the lunar surface.

There are some constraints regarding the trajectory, fuel and oxidizer selection, and fuel handling; therefore, the design was done in accordance with the requirements and constraints. In this report, the main emphasis will be on the trajectory, propellant selection and optimization, design of the vehicle, survivability, and operational issues.

The project was done for the final project of MECH 427 - Introduction to Propulsion Systems course at Koc University
The material can be used as a reference yet should not be copied to be used in upcoming projects.

## Scenarios
There are three different scenarios under the name mainX.m, mainY.m, mainZ.m, which all use the same framework yet follow different paths by utilizing different strategies!
