# MECH427: Lunar Descent Vehicle Design Project

## Overview
This project focuses on designing a lunar descent vehicle capable of transporting a payload from lunar orbit to the moon's surface. Key aspects include safety, minimization of hardware mass, and robustness under lunar conditions. There are some constraints regarding the trajectory, fuel and oxidizer selection, and fuel handling; therefore, the design was done under the requirements and constraints. In this report, the main emphasis will be on the trajectory, propellant selection and optimization, vehicle design, survivability, and operational issues.


## Mission Objective
Design a vehicle to transport a payload from lunar orbit to the lunar surface, focusing on safety, mass efficiency, and performance under lunar conditions. 

## Design Highlights
- **Propellant Selection:** Aerozine 50 and Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) were chosen for their performance and storability.
- **Rocket Design:** Key components include the nozzle, combustion chamber, and propellant tanks, designed with emphasis on efficiency and reliability.
- **Survivability:** Special measures to ensure the vehicle's operation on the lunar surface.

## Simulation and Results
- MATLAB simulations were conducted for trajectory analysis and delta-V budgeting.
- The results indicate efficient propellant consumption and adherence to mission constraints.
- There are three different scenarios under the name mainX.m, mainY.m, mainZ.m, which all use the same framework yet follow different paths by utilizing different strategies!

## Repository Contents
- `Project Report`: Visual representations of the vehicle's design and components.
- `Final CEA Simulation Results`: Results of the chemical equilibrium analysis for propellant optimization.
- `MATLAB Simulation Code`: Code used for trajectory analysis and simulation of the vehicle's descent.
